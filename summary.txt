Here is a summary of the document in around 1000 words:

The document appears to be a transcript of a lecture on 3D coordinate geometry. The key points covered are:

Introduction to 3D Coordinate Geometry
- In 3D, a point is represented by three coordinates (x, y, z) instead of two coordinates (x, y) in 2D geometry.
- The three coordinate axes are X, Y and Z axes.
- The X-coordinate represents the distance from the YZ plane, Y-coordinate represents distance from XZ plane and Z-coordinate represents distance from XY plane.

Distance Formula
- The distance between two points A(x1, y1, z1) and B(x2, y2, z2) is given by:
âˆš[(x2-x1)2 + (y2-y1)2 + (z2-z1)2]

Section Formula
- To find the coordinates of a point R that divides the line segment AB internally in the ratio m1:m2
The coordinates are: 
(m1x2 + m2x1)/(m1 + m2), (m1y2 + m2y1)/(m1 + m2), (m1z2 + m2z1)/(m1 + m2)

Condition for Collinearity of 3 Points
- Three points A(x1, y1, z1), B(x2, y2, z2) and C(x3, y3, z3) are collinear if:
(x1-x2)/(x2-x3) = (y1-y2)/(y2-y3) = (z1-z2)/(z2-z3)

Mid-Point Formula
- The mid-point M of the line segment AB has coordinates:
((x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2, (z1+z2)/2)

Centroid
- The centroid (center of mass) of a triangle with vertices A(x1,y1,z1), B(x2,y2,z2), C(x3,y3,z3) is:
((x1+x2+x3)/3, (y1+y2+y3)/3, (z1+z2+z3)/3)

- The centroid of a tetrahedron (pyramid with triangular base and 3 other triangular faces meeting at a common vertex) with vertices A,B,C,D is: 
((x1+x2+x3+x4)/4, (y1+y2+y3+y4)/4, (z1+z2+z3+z4)/4)

Properties of Parallelograms/Parallelepipeds in 3D
- Condition for two line segments AB and CD to be parallel is that their direction ratios (slopes) are equal.

The lecture covers formulas and concepts similar to 2D coordinate geometry, but extended to the third dimension using all three coordinates x, y and z. Concepts like distance, section formula, collinearity condition, mid-point, centroid are discussed along with their 3D formulas. Properties of 3D shapes like parallelograms/parallelepipeds in terms of parallel line segments are also mentioned.
