Here is a summary of the document in around 1000 words:

The document appears to be a transcript of a lecture on 3D coordinate geometry. The key points covered are:

Introduction to 3D Coordinate Geometry
- Just like in 2D coordinate geometry, in 3D we have x, y and z coordinate axes
- A point P with coordinates (x,y,z) is located at distances x from yz-plane, y from xz-plane and z from xy-plane
- The equations of the coordinate planes are: xy-plane: z=0, yz-plane: x=0, xz-plane: y=0

Distance Formula
- The distance between two points A(x1,y1,z1) and B(x2,y2,z2) is given by:
âˆš[(x2-x1)2 + (y2-y1)2 + (z2-z1)2]
- This can be used to find the nature of a triangle (isosceles, scalene etc) or quadrilateral (square, rectangle etc) formed by given points

Section Formula
- To find the coordinates of a point R that divides the line segment AB internally in the ratio m1:m2
  xR = (m1x2 + m2x1)/(m1+m2)
  yR = (m1y2 + m2y1)/(m1+m2) 
  zR = (m1z2 + m2z1)/(m1+m2)

- For external division, the formula is similar with m1 and m2 interchanged

Centroid
- Centroid of a triangle with vertices A(x1,y1,z1), B(x2,y2,z2), C(x3,y3,z3) is given by:
  (x1+x2+x3)/3, (y1+y2+y3)/3, (z1+z2+z3)/3

- Centroid of a tetrahedron with vertices A,B,C,D is given by: 
  (x1+x2+x3+x4)/4, (y1+y2+y3+y4)/4, (z1+z2+z3+z4)/4

The lecture covers the basics of locating points, finding distances between them, dividing line segments and finding centroids of simple 3D figures like triangles and tetrahedrons. The formulas are derived from extending the corresponding 2D concepts to 3D. Examples and practice questions are discussed throughout to reinforce the concepts.
