Here is a summary of the educational video in around 1000 words:

The video starts with the instructor introducing the topic of 3D coordinate geometry. He explains that just like in 2D coordinate geometry where points are represented using x and y coordinates, in 3D we have an additional z coordinate as well. 

He demonstrates how any point P in 3D space can be represented using its (x, y, z) coordinates. The x-coordinate represents the distance from the YZ plane, y-coordinate represents distance from XZ plane, and z-coordinate represents distance from XY plane.

The instructor then derives the distance formula between two points A(x1, y1, z1) and B(x2, y2, z2) in 3D space, which is given by âˆš[(x2-x1)2 + (y2-y1)2 + (z2-z1)2].

He explains how this distance formula can be used to find the nature of a triangle formed by three given points - whether it is an acute angled, right angled or obtuse angled triangle based on the lengths of the sides.

For four given points, one can find the nature of the quadrilateral formed - whether it is a square, rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram etc. by using the distance formula.

The concept of collinearity of three points in 3D is also discussed. Three points A(x1, y1, z1), B(x2, y2, z2) and C(x3, y3, z3) are collinear if (x1-x2)/(x2-x3) = (y1-y2)/(y2-y3) = (z1-z2)/(z2-z3).

The mid-point formula for the mid-point M of the line segment joining two points A and B is derived as M((x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2, (z1+z2)/2).

The video then moves on to the concept of centroid. The centroid or geometric center of a triangle with vertices A, B, C is given by ((x1+x2+x3)/3, (y1+y2+y3)/3, (z1+z2+z3)/3).

Similarly, for a tetrahedron (3D shape with 4 triangular faces) with vertices A, B, C, D, the centroid is ((x1+x2+x3+x4)/4, (y1+y2+y3+y4)/4, (z1+z2+z3+z4)/4).

Finally, the section formula is discussed which gives the coordinates of the point R that divides the line segment AB in the ratio m1:m2 internally. The coordinates are given by (m1*x2 + m2*x1)/(m1+m2), (m1*y2 + m2*y1)/(m1+m2), (m1*z2 + m2*z1)/(m1+m2).

The external section formula to find the point R' that divides AB externally in the ratio m1:m2 is also mentioned briefly.

Overall, the video covers the key concepts of 3D coordinate geometry in a systematic manner, deriving the formulas and explaining their applications with examples. The instructor engages the students through questioning as well.
