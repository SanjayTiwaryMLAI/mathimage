Challenges in Creating Math Images

The key challenges in creating mathematical images for the edtech customer were:
1. Generating accurate, small images of shapes like triangles and circles to match the textual questions and solutions.
 This required precision in plotting the shapes to represent the mathematical concepts properly. 
 
2. Presenting the questions and solutions in Hindi language, in addition to the visual elements. 
Translating the textual content into Hindi increased complexity.

3. Ensuring tight integration between the textual questions/solutions and corresponding images. 
The images had to visually represent the concepts stated in text, requiring coordination.

4. Achieving mathematically correct visual results and depictions in the generated images.
 As educational resources, maintaining accuracy was critical.

5. Overcoming limitations in Stable Diffusion and other AI image generation models in producing such specialized math images tied to textual concepts. 
The models fell short on handling such narrow, subject-specific image generation.

Step-by-Step Approach to Solve the Problem 

To address these challenges, I solved the math image generation problem through a methodical, step-by-step approach:

1. Summarized entire classroom recordings in 1000 words to extract key mathematical learnings, concepts and problems.
 This distilled knowledge became the basis for image content.

2. Augmented the summaries with classroom notes to ensure no key information was missed. 
The augmented notes gave the full picture. 

3. Turned the math concepts, problems and solutions from the summaries and notes into textual question-answers pairs.
 This gave the content foundation.

4. Used Claude 3 model to algorithmically generate key mathematical shapes like triangles, circles by extracting them 
from the question-answer text through NLP.

5. Wrote a Python script that leveraged Seaborn data visualization library to programmatically create images for 
each question-answer pair based on the extracted shapes.

6. Encapsulated the image generation code into a reusable Python function for maintainability.

7. Stored the programmatically generated images and displayed them alongside the matching textual content. 
This achieved the integrated math text-image content.

8. Finally, translated the entire textual content including textual questions, answers, explanations and
 descriptions into Hindi using translation APIs/tools while retaining the images.

This step-by-step, structured approach helped overcome the key challenges in generating tailored, accurate and 
integrated math images tied to the educational text content. The process combined the powers of Claude 3, Python scripts, Seaborn and translation tools.
