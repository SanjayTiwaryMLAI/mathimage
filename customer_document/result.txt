Which of the following represents the equation of the x-axis in 3D space? a) y = 0, z = 0 b) x = 0, y = 0 c) x = 0, z = 0 d) x = 0, y = 0, z = 0
Answer: a) y = 0, z = 0 Explanation: The x-axis in 3D space is represented by the equations y = 0 and z = 0, which means that all points on the x-axis have y and z coordinates equal to zero.

If the coordinates of two points A and B in 3D space are A(x1, y1, z1) and B(x2, y2, z2), respectively, what is the formula to find the distance between them? a) √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2) b) (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2 c) (x2 + x1)^2 + (y2 + y1)^2 + (z2 + z1)^2 d) √((x2 + x1)^2 + (y2 + y1)^2 + (z2 + z1)^2)
Answer: a) √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2) Explanation: The distance formula in 3D space is an extension of the 2D distance formula, where the differences in the x, y, and z coordinates are squared, added, and then the square root is taken.

If three points A(x1, y1, z1), B(x2, y2, z2), and C(x3, y3, z3) are collinear (lie on the same line), which condition must be satisfied? a) (x2 - x1) / (y2 - y1) = (x3 - x2) / (y3 - y2) = (x3 - x1) / (y3 - y1) b) (x2 - x1) / (y2 - y1) = (x3 - x2) / (z3 - z2) = (x3 - x1) / (z3 - z1) c) (x2 - x1) / (z2 - z1) = (x3 - x2) / (z3 - z2) = (x3 - x1) / (z3 - z1) d) (y2 - y1) / (z2 - z1) = (y3 - y2) / (z3 - z2) = (y3 - y1) / (z3 - z1)
Answer: c) (x2 - x1) / (z2 - z1) = (x3 - x2) / (z3 - z2) = (x3 - x1) / (z3 - z1) Explanation: For three points to be collinear in 3D space, the ratios of the differences in their x, y, and z coordinates must be equal. The given condition checks the equality of ratios for the x and z coordinates.

What is the formula to find the centroid (center of mass) of a triangle with vertices A(x1, y1, z1), B(x2, y2, z2), and C(x3, y3, z3) in 3D space? a) ((x1 + x2 + x3)/3, (y1 + y2 + y3)/3, (z1 + z2 + z3)/3) b) ((x1 - x2 - x3)/3, (y1 - y2 - y3)/3, (z1 - z2 - z3)/3) c) ((x1 * x2 * x3)/3, (y1 * y2 * y3)/3, (z1 * z2 * z3)/3) d) ((x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2)/3, (y1^2 + y2^2 + y3^2)/3, (z1^2 + z2^2 + z3^2)/3)
Answer: a) ((x1 + x2 + x3)/3, (y1 + y2 + y3)/3, (z1 + z2 + z3)/3) Explanation: The centroid of a triangle in 3D space is the point whose x, y, and z coordinates are the averages of the respective coordinates of the three vertices.

If a plane with equation ax + by + cz + d = 0 divides the line segment between two points A(x1, y1, z1) and B(x2, y2, z2) internally in the ratio k:1, what is the ratio of the distances of the point of division from A and B? a) (ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d) / (ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d) b) (ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d) / (ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d) c) k / (ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d) d) k / (ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d)
Answer: d) k / (ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d) Explanation: The ratio of the distances of the point of division from A and B is equal to the ratio in which the plane divides the line segment. The distance from A to the point of division is proportional to (ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d), and the distance from B to the point of division is proportional to (ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d). The ratio of these distances is k:1, so the ratio is k / (ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d).
