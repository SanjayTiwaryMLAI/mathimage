Here is a summary of the document in around 1000 words:

The document is a transcript of an online lecture on 3D coordinate geometry. The key points covered are:

Introduction to 3D Coordinate Geometry
- Just like in 2D coordinate geometry, in 3D we have coordinates to represent the position of a point, but now we need three coordinates (x, y, z) instead of two. 
- The three coordinate axes are x, y and z axes, perpendicular to each other.
- The coordinates of a point P are written as (x, y, z) where x is the perpendicular distance from yz-plane, y is the perpendicular distance from xz-plane and z is the perpendicular distance from xy-plane.

Distance Formula in 3D
- The distance between two points A(x1, y1, z1) and B(x2, y2, z2) is given by:
âˆš[(x2-x1)2 + (y2-y1)2 + (z2-z1)2]

Section Formula and Ratio Formula
- To find the ratio in which a line segment is divided by a plane Ax + By + Cz + D = 0, the formula is: 
(Ax1 + By1 + Cz1 + D) : (Ax2 + By2 + Cz2 + D)
- Internal and external division point formulas are derived using this ratio.

Mid-Point Formula
- The mid-point M of the line segment joining A(x1, y1, z1) and B(x2, y2, z2) has coordinates:
M = ((x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2, (z1+z2)/2)  

Centroid
- The centroid (center of mass) of a triangle with vertices A(x1,y1,z1), B(x2,y2,z2), C(x3,y3,z3) has coordinates:
((ax1 + bx2 + cx3)/(a+b+c), (ay1 + by2 + cy3)/(a+b+c), (az1 + bz2 + cz3)/(a+b+c))
where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite A, B, C respectively.

- For a tetrahedron with vertices A, B, C, D, the centroid formula is:
((ax1 + bx2 + cx3 + dx4)/(a+b+c+d), ...similarly for y and z coordinates)

The lecture also covered some examples and practice questions related to finding coordinates satisfying colinearity conditions, finding the fourth vertex of a parallelogram given three consecutive vertices, and using the formulas learned.

Overall, the key formulas and concepts of 3D coordinate geometry like distance formula, section formula, mid-point formula, centroid were explained in detail using examples. The similarity to 2D coordinate geometry concepts was also highlighted.
