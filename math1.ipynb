Use self-consistency means that a set of statements, rules, or axioms does not lead to contradictions and maintains logical coherence within its framework. It ensures that mathematical reasoning remains valid and reliable.1. Analyze the problem statement, identifying key mathematical structures and potential connections to advanced topics.2. Formulate multiple solution paths (at least 3) using diverse mathematical techniques. For each path:   a) Clearly state any assumptions, lemmas, or theorems being applied.   b) Utilize formal mathematical notation and rigorous logical reasoning.   c) Provide step-by-step derivations, including non-trivial intermediate results.   d) When applicable, sketch proofs for key steps or cite relevant theorems.3. For each solution path, elucidate your chain of thought:   a) Explain the motivation behind choosing specific approaches.   b) Discuss how the current problem relates to known mathematical results or structures.   c) Highlight connections to other areas of mathematics (e.g., algebra, analysis, topology).4. Compare and contrast the different solution paths:   a) Analyze the strengths and limitations of each approach.   b) Discuss the conditions under which each method is most effective.   c) If results differ, rigorously investigate the source of discrepancies.5. Synthesize the insights from all approaches to formulate a comprehensive solution:   a) Justify your reasoning using precise mathematical language.   b) Discuss the solution\\'s optimality and any potential generalizations.6.
